## Design Style

The project features a sleek, modern design with a dark theme and smooth gradients to create an immersive user experience.

### Key Design Features:

- **Background**: The body background uses a *radial gradient* that transitions from a dark blue (#1B2735) at the bottom to a deep black (#090A0F) at the top, providing a subtle, immersive effect.
- **Font**: The project uses the *Ubuntu* font-family, which is sans-serif and modern, ensuring readability and a clean, minimalist look.
- **Text Colour**: The text colour is set to white (#fff), offering strong contrast against the dark background for clear visibility.
- **Layout**: The body is set to take up the full width of the screen and has a minimum height of 100vh (viewport height), ensuring that content stretches to fill the entire screen. The vertical overflow is set to *overlay*, allowing smooth scrolling without additional space at the edges.

 ### Design Resources  
All pictures used in this project were sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), a platform offering high-quality, royalty-free images. These images were carefully selected to enhance the visual appeal and user experience of the web application.  


### Additional Styling:

- **Lines**: Horizontal lines are styled with a height of 2px and a grey colour. This subtle element helps to separate sections of content visually.
  
```css
.line {
    height: 2px;
    border-width: 0;
    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
    background-color: gray;
}
```

## Development Process
<img src="./assets/wireframes/development-process.png" alt="Desktop Screenshot" width="630"><br>

The creation of the web app followed a structured and organised process to ensure modularity, reusability, and quality across all components. Below are the steps that were followed:

### 1. Create the Component
Each feature of the web app is developed as a reusable custom HTML component using JavaScript. These components encapsulate their own logic and can easily be integrated into multiple pages. 

#### Example of a Component:  
```javascript
class TheComponent extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    const newsData = {
      "jsonText": [
        {
          "TheText": "random text",
        }
      ]
    };

    this.innerHTML = `
      <div class="news">
        <p>${newsData.jsonText[0].TheText}</p>
      </div>
    `;
  }
}

window.customElements.define('the-component', TheComponent);
```
### 2. Design the HTML Component & `<body>` Pages with CSS
After defining the functionality of a component, a corresponding CSS file is created to style it. Separating the logic and presentation ensures the project is easier to maintain, scale, and debug.

#### 1. `style.css` – Global Stylesheet
This stylesheet applies general styles for the HTML pages, ensuring consistency and resetting browser defaults.

```css
/* General Reset */
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Body Styling */
body {
  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.6;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  color: #333; /* Correct spelling of "colour" */
  overflow-x: hidden;
}
```
#### 2. `TheComponent.css` – Component-Specific Styles
Each custom component is styled in its own CSS file to ensure modularity. Below is an example of styling for a news card component:

```css
.news {
  padding: 20px; /* Add inner spacing */
  gap: 16px; /* Space between child elements */
  background-color: #fff; /* Light background for contrast */
  border: 1px solid #ddd; /* Subtle border */
  border-radius: 8px; /* Smooth corners */
  box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); /* Light shadow for depth */
}
```
**Example Workflow:**

1. Define the component's structure and functionality in JavaScript.
2. Write a separate CSS file to style the component's layout, colours, and behaviour.
3. Link the component's CSS file to the global styles or import it where needed.

---

### 3. Structure the HTML Page
The application is divided into different HTML pages, such as **Home**, **About**, **News**, and **Contact**, each using the custom components created in Step 1. The structure of each page is carefully designed to provide a user-friendly interface while adhering to semantic HTML standards.

**Example of HTML Structure:**
```html
<head>
  <!--css styles-->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/navbar.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/about.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/the-component.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/footer.css">
</head>

<body>
  <nav>
    <navbar-component></navbar-component>
  </nav>
  <header>
    <header-component></header-component>
  </header>
  <section>
    <the-component></the-component>
  </section>
  <footer>
    <footer-component></footer-component>
  </footer>
 
  <!--Including the components JavaScript-->
  <script src="../components/navbar.js"></script>
  <script src="../components/header.js"></script>
  <script src="../components/the-component.js"></script>
  <script src="../components/footer.js"></script>
</body>
```
### 4. Testing
To ensure quality and functionality, the following testing processes were conducted:

- **Jest**: Used for unit testing custom components to verify their behaviour and logic.
- **W3C Validator**: Used to validate the HTML and CSS for compliance with web standards, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and accessibility.

This systematic approach ensures that the web app is modular, visually appealing, and meets high standards of qualitys

# The Component Development Process 
## Creating the Component
To create the component, follow these steps:
Each component in the project follows the same basic structure. Here’s how to create a new component:

## 1. Create the Component Class
Start by creating a class that extends `HTMLElement`. The name of the class should match the component name (e.g., `headerComponent` for the header, `footerComponent` for the footer)..

```js
class TheComponent extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    // Insert your code to create dynamic content here
  }
}
``` 
## 2. Define the Data (JSON)
Inside the `connectedCallback()` method, define the data that the component will use. This could be an array or an object.

```js
const data = [
  {
    "property1": "value1",
    "property2": "value2",
    // More properties as needed
  },
  // Add more items if needed
];
``` 
## 3. Generate the HTML Dynamically
Use the data to dynamically generate the HTML for the component. Loop through the data and create individual items.

```js
const itemsHTML = data.map(item => `
  <div class="item">
    <img src="${item.picture}" alt="${item.property1}" />
    <div class="content">
      <h2 class="title">${item.property1}</h2>
      <p class="description">${item.property2}</p>
      <a href="${item.url}" class="read-more-button"><button>Read More</button></a>
    </div>
  </div>
`).join('');
``` 
## 4. Set the Inner HTML
Insert the generated HTML inside the component using `this.innerHTML`.
```js
this.innerHTML = `
  <div class="the-component-container">
    ${itemsHTML}
  </div>
`;
``` 
## 5. Add Event Listeners (if necessary)
If your component includes interactive elements (like buttons or sliders), add event listeners to handle user interactions. For example, if you have "Next" and "Previous" buttons:

```js
function activate(e) {
  const items = document.querySelectorAll(".item");
  if (e.target.matches(".next")) {
    document.querySelector(".slider").append(items[0]);
  }
  if (e.target.matches(".prev")) {
    document.querySelector(".slider").prepend(items[items.length - 1]);
  }
}

document.addEventListener("click", activate, false);
``` 
## 6. Set Up Automatic Behaviour (if necessary)
For components like sliders, you might want to implement automatic behaviour, such as auto-changing slides. This can be done using `setInterval`:
```js
setInterval(() => document.querySelector(".next").click(), 4000);

``` 
## 7. Register the Component
Finally, register the component with a unique tag name for it (e.g., `<the-component>`).
```js
window.customElements.define('the-component', TheComponent);
```

### Problem: Unable to Push Changes Due to Remote Conflicts

While attempting to push changes to the remote repository, the following error occurred:

### Resolution

The issue occurred because there were changes on the remote repository that were not present locally. To resolve this:

1. **Pulled the latest changes** from the remote repository to synchronize the local branch with the remote one:

```bash
git pull origin master
```

### Resolved Merge Conflicts

During the pull process, merge conflicts appeared. After editing the conflicted files, they were staged and committed with the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
```
### Pushed Changes to Remote Repository

After resolving the merge conflicts and committing the changes, the updates were pushed back to the remote repository with the following command:

```bash
git push origin master
```
### Synchronization of Local and Remote Repositories

This process ensured that both the local and remote repositories were synchronized, resolving the issue and allowing for a successful push.

 ## HTML and CSS Validation

### W3C HTML Validation
The HTML code was validated using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/). During validation, I reviewed the following:
## Fixing Fatal Error in HTML Validation  

### **Problem:**  
When validating the HTML file with the W3C Validator, the following **fatal error** appeared:  

```
Fatal Error: Cannot recover after last error. Any further errors will be ignored.

From line 38, column 1; to line 38, column 7

↩</head>↩<title>The Gl
```
❌ Incorrect Structure **(causes error):**
```html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>

<title>The Global News</title> <!-- ❌ This should be inside <head> -->

<body>
```

### **Cause of the Error:**  
The `<title>` tag was placed **outside the `<head>` section**, which breaks the document structure and causes the validation to fail.  

### **Solution:**  
Move the `<title>` tag inside the `<head>` section:  

#### ✅ **Correct Structure:**
```html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    
    <title>The Global News</title>  <!-- ✅ Title placed correctly inside <head> -->

    <!-- Other meta tags and stylesheets -->
</head>
```
## Result After Fixing  

- The W3C Validator no longer shows the **Fatal Error**.  
- The HTML document structure is now **correct**.  
- The page loads without **structural issues** in all browsers.  


### W3C CSS Validation
The CSS code was validated using the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator). During validation, I reviewed the following:

# CSS Fixes for `cards-journalist.css`

## Issue 1: Invalid Negative `gap` Value in `.row`
- **Error:** Negative values are not allowed for `gap` in CSS.
- **Fix:** Change `gap: -60px;` to `gap: 0;` or adjust spacing using `margin-top`.

### **Before:**
```css
.row {
    gap: -60px; /* ❌ Invalid */
}
```
### After:
```css
.row {
    gap: 0; /* ✅ Valid */
}
```
If reducing spacing is necessary, use:
```css
.row {
    margin-top: -60px; /* Moves content upwards */
}
```
---
## Issue 2: Identical `color` and `background-color` in `.card`
**Error:** The .card element has the same color and background-color, making text unreadable.
Fix: Adjust either color or background-color to improve contrast.
### Before:
```css
.card {
    color: #bfc9cd;
    background-color: #bfc9cd; /* ❌ Text blends with background */
}
```
### After:
```css
.card {
    color: #273338; /* ✅ Darker text */
    background-color: #bfc9cd;
}
```
Alternatively, you can use:
```css
.card {
    color: white;
    background-color: #bfc9cd;
}
```
---
## Test Results

All tests passed successfully, confirming the functionality of the `aboutHeaderComponent`.

---
## Jest Testing

The project was thoroughly tested using Jest to ensure that all components function correctly. A total of **22 components** were tested, covering various aspects of the application, including dynamic content rendering, user interactions, and responsive behaviours.

The project relies on `Node.js` and `Jest` for testing. Two important files, `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, are used to manage the dependencies and the environment for the project.

### package.json
The `package.json` file is a fundamental part of the Node.js ecosystem. It holds metadata about the project, such as the project's name, version, scripts, and dependencies. For this project, it is used to specify the Jest testing framework as a dependency and to define the testing script to run tests.

The `package.json` file includes:

- **Dependencies**: This includes Jest, which is used to run the unit and integration tests for the components.
- **Scripts**: Common commands to run the project, such as `npm test` to run the tests using Jest.

You can find the `package.json` file in the root directory of the project.

### package-lock.json
The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated when you run `npm install`. It locks the versions of the dependencies to ensure that the project works the same way across different environments. It helps to maintain consistent and reliable installations of dependencies.

The `package-lock.json`:

- Ensures that the exact same versions of dependencies are installed on every machine that clones the project.
- Helps with dependency management by preventing any unintended updates or breaking changes when installing dependencies.


### Key Tests Included:
- **Component Structure**: Ensured that each component rendered its expected structure, including dynamic elements like news lists and clocks.
- **State Updates**: Verified that components like the clock and breaking news list updated in real-time as expected.
- **CSS and Animation**: Tested animation durations and ensured they were set correctly, alongside component styling.
- **Error Handling**: Checked for correct behaviour when missing or incorrect data was provided.


All tests passed successfully, ensuring the components are working as expected.

### Issue: `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module`

- **Cause**: Jest encountered an import statement but wasn't configured for ES Modules.
- **Solution**: Ensure Babel is configured to transform your code:

```bash
npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```
---
### Issue: `Jest encountered an unexpected token`

- **Cause**: Jest needs to be configured to support ES Modules or JSX.
- **Solution**: In your `package.json`, make sure the following configuration is added for Jest:

```json
"jest": {
  "testEnvironment": "jsdom"
}
```

## Why Integrate Babel and Node Modules?

After running tests for the `about-header.js` component, you might encounter issues related to Jest not properly handling ES modules or JSX syntax. This is where Babel and the necessary node modules come into play. Here's why and how to integrate them:

### 1. **Why Use Babel?**
   Babel is a tool that allows you to use the latest JavaScript features (like ES6 modules or JSX) in your code while ensuring compatibility with older JavaScript environments. Jest, by default, may not understand the newer syntax unless you explicitly tell it to use Babel for transpiling. 

### 2. **Why Configure Jest?**
   Jest runs tests in a Node.js environment, which is different from a browser. If you're using ES modules or JSX, Jest won't be able to parse them without the right configuration. This is why we need to set up Babel to transpile the code before Jest can run the tests properly.

### 3. **Steps to Integrate Babel and Node Modules**

   - **Install Babel and Related Dependencies**:
     Babel can be integrated into your project using the following npm packages: `babel-jest`, `@babel/core`, and `@babel/preset-env`. These packages allow Jest to understand modern JavaScript syntax.

     To install Babel, run the following command in your project directory:

     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
     ```

   - **Configure Jest to Use Babel**:
     After installing Babel, you need to tell Jest to use it by adding the `transform` configuration to your `package.json`. This ensures that Jest uses Babel to transpile `.js` files during testing.

     In your `package.json`, add the following Jest configuration:

     ```json
     "jest": {
       "transform": {
         "^.+\\.js$": "babel-jest"
       }
     }
     ```

     This configuration ensures that all `.js` files in your project will be processed by `babel-jest` before Jest runs the tests.

### 4. **Benefit**
   By integrating Babel and configuring Jest in this way, you'll be able to use modern JavaScript features like ES modules and JSX, while also ensuring that your tests run smoothly without any syntax errors.

# Footer Component
---
## Overview
<img src="./assets/wireframes_components/footer_component.png" alt="Desktop Screenshot" width="330"><br>
## Footer Component Design
The footer component of the project is a crucial part of the website's layout, providing essential information and links in a clean and user-friendly manner. Here's a breakdown of its design:

## Purpose:
The footer is designed to provide additional site navigation, social media links, and legal information (such as copyright details) in a simple, compact format.

## Responsiveness:
The design ensures that the footer adapts to different screen sizes, maintaining accessibility and functionality on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Structure:
It consists of multiple sections:

## Contact Information:
 Provides details like the company address, email, and phone number.
Social Media Links: Displays icons that link to the project's social media accounts.
Legal Information: Includes copyright information and links to privacy policies or terms of service.

While running npm test in the project, you may encounter the following error message:

```bash
Validation Error:
 Module <rootDir>/setupTests.js in the setupFilesAfterEnv option was not found.
 ```
This occurs because Jest is looking for a `setupTests.js` file to configure the testing environment, such as adding custom matchers from @testing-library/jest-dom. Without this file, Jest will not know how to properly set up the environment for testing.

---
## Solution: Adding `setupTests.js`
Create the setupTests.js File:
Add a new file called `jest.setup.js` in the root directory of your project, next to package.json.

## Add Jest DOM Import:
Import @testing-library/jest-dom into the jest.setup.js file:

```javascript

import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
Update Jest Configuration:
```
In the package.json, add a setupFilesAfterEnv key to the Jest configuration. This will tell Jest where to look for the setup file.

## Example:

```json

"jest": {
  "testEnvironment": "jsdom",
  "transform": {
    "^.+\\.js$": "babel-jest"
  },
  "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["<rootDir>/setupTests.js"]
}
```
## Run Tests Again:
Once the setup is complete, running npm test will ensure that Jest sets up the environment correctly for testing.

## File Details
- **Component File**: `./components/footer.js`
- **Stylesheet**: `./css/footer.css`
- **Wireframe Design**: `./assets/wireframes_components/footer_component.png`
---
## Test Results After Fix
After making the necessary changes to the Jest setup, running npm test will ensure that the environment is correctly set up for testing, including for the footer component. This will also confirm the functionality and design integrity of the footer.

```bash
> npm test

# News Section Components (Business, Sports, Politics, Technology)

## Overview

<img src="./assets/wireframes_components/news_section_component.png" alt="Desktop Screenshot" width="330"><br>
The four main components—**Technology Section**, **Sport Section**, **Business Section**, and **Politics Section**—share a common **CSS style** file, `cards.css`, to ensure consistent and cohesive styling across the website's sections.

Each of these components represents a different category of news, which is displayed in a structured format, typically using cards or list items. By sharing the same stylesheet, all four sections maintain a unified design, with consistent spacing, layout, typography, and visual appearance. This approach ensures that the user experience is seamless, regardless of which section they are viewing.

These sections are crucial for the homepage of the website, acting as the primary content areas where users can explore the latest updates in different fields:

## Understanding it() vs test() in Jest
When writing tests in Jest, you may notice two functions used to define test cases: it() and test(). Both serve the same purpose and are functionally equivalent—they define a single test case. However, there are subtle stylistic differences that may guide your choice.
### Why Use `it()`?
- `it()` is often used in Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) practices.

- It allows you to write test cases in a more natural language-like style, describing the behaviour of the component or functionality being tested.

- Example:
```javascript
it('should render the business news cards', () => {
    // Test logic
});
```
This reads as a sentence: "It should render the business news cards."

### Why Use `test()`?
 - `test()` is more generic and often used when the test does not need to follow a natural language description.

 - It works just as well as `it()` and is slightly shorter to type.

 - Example:

 ```javascript
 test('renders the business news cards', () => {
    // Test logic
});
 ```
 ### We can Mix `it()` and `test()`?
 Yes! Jest allows you to mix them, but for consistency, it’s recommended to standardise on one style across your test suite.
### When to Use Which? 

- ***Follow Project or Team Conventions:*** If your team prefers `it()` for behaviour-focused descriptions, use that. If no preference exists, stick to `test()` for simplicity.

- ***Natural Descriptions:*** Use `it()` if you want test cases that read more like sentences, especially in BDD-oriented projects.

- ***Consistency is Key*** Choose one style and apply it consistently to make your tests easier to read and maintain.

### Example of Both in Action
```javascript
// Using 'it' for natural language descriptions
it('should render the correct number of business news cards', () => {
    // Test logic
});

// Using 'test' for a generic test case
test('renders the business news section', () => {
    // Test logic
});
```
Both work the same way. The choice depends on personal or team preferences.

# Card Slide component
---
<img src="./assets/wireframes_components/slide_card_component.png" alt="Desktop Screenshot" width="330"><br>
The Card Slides Component was designed to add dynamic, animated functionality to the Global News homepage. Positioned at the bottom of the page, it allows users to easily view the latest news headlines through a smooth, auto-sliding carousel. This feature ensures that users are always up-to-date with the most recent stories, while enhancing the visual appeal and interactivity of the website. The component is fully responsive and allows users to manually navigate through news cards or let the carousel slide automatically, making it both engaging and user-friendly.

---
## Testing the Card Slides Component

### Overview
The testing for the Card Slides Component was carried out using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework. The goal of the tests was to ensure that the custom cardslides-component was correctly defined, and that it dynamically generated the expected HTML structure. Additionally, the functionality of integrating the Owl Carousel plugin was checked to verify that the component was working as intended.

### Issues Encountered and Solutions
### Mocking Owl Carousel:
Jest does not directly support the Owl Carousel plugin, so we needed to mock the plugin to ensure that our tests could run successfully without relying on the actual library. We created a mock version of the Owl Carousel plugin, using jest.mock to simulate its behaviour during testing:

```javascript
jest.mock('owl.carousel', () => ({
    owlCarousel: jest.fn(),
}));
```
### Handling jQuery:
Since the Owl Carousel plugin requires jQuery, we encountered issues with Jest not recognizing the `$` symbol. To resolve this, we created a mock for jQuery in the `__mocks__/jquery.js` file. This allows Jest to properly interpret and mock jQuery functionality without encountering errors during tests:

```javascript
const $ = require('jquery');
global.$ = $;
```
### What are Mocks?
Mocks are simulated objects or functions used in testing to mimic the behaviour of real components, such as external libraries or APIs. They allow you to isolate your code by replacing real dependencies, helping to make tests run faster and more reliably.

In this project, we mocked the Owl Carousel plugin to avoid relying on the actual library during tests. This ensures that tests can run independently and without external dependencies.

### CSS Importing:
The CSS file `css/slides-card.css` is used by the Card Slides Component to style the elements. While Jest focuses on JavaScript testing, it doesn't handle CSS directly. To address this, we used an appropriate test environment setup to ignore CSS imports, ensuring that the focus remained on the JavaScript functionality of the component.

## Tests and Assertions
### Card Slides as a Custom Element:
The first test ensures that the custom element `cardslides-component` is correctly defined using the customElements.get method:
```javascript
test('should define CardSlides as a custom element', () => {
  expect(customElements.get('cardslides-component')).toBeDefined();
});
```
### HTML Structure:
The second test checks whether the correct HTML structure is dynamically generated by the component. (Note: Specific assertions for this test were not added but can be customized based on the expected HTML output.)

# The News components

## Overview
<img src="./assets/wireframes_components/news_component.png" alt="Desktop Screenshot" width="330"><br>
The Global News Project is a dynamic web application that provides news coverage across four key categories: Business, Sports, Politics, and Technology. Each category is structured into individual components and subpages, making the project modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.

### Components and Organisation
### Components
Each news section is built as a reusable custom web component, coded in its corresponding JavaScript file. These components dynamically render news articles using JSON data. Below is the breakdown of the components:

- Business News Component: business-news.js
- Sports News Component: sports-news.js
- Politics News Component: politics-news.js
- Technology News Component: technology-news.js

The test files for these components follow a consistent naming convention:

- business-news.test.js
- sports-news.test.js
- politics-news.test.js
- technology-news.test.js

## Folder Structure
The application’s folder structure is organised to keep the project modular:
```javascript
/pages
   /business-news
      business1.html
          <business-component news-index="0"></business-component>
      business2.html
          <business-component news-index="1"></business-component>
      business3.html
          <business-component news-index="2"></business-component>
   /politics-news
      politics1.html
          <politics-component news-index="0"></politics-component>
      politics2.html
          <politics-component news-index="1"></politics-component>
      politics3.html
          <politics-component news-index="2"></politics-component>
   /sports-news
      sport1.html
          <sports-component news-index="0"></sports-component>
      sport2.html
          <sports-component news-index="1"></sports-component>
      sport3.html
          <sports-component news-index="2"></sports-component>
   /tech-news
      tech1.html
          <tech-component news-index="0"></tech-component>
      tech2.html
          <tech-component news-index="1"></tech-component>
      tech3.html
          <tech-component news-index="2"></tech-component>
```
## CSS
All components share the same CSS file: /css/the-news.css. This ensures visual consistency across all news sections.

## Testing the Components
Each component has been rigorously tested using Jest. The tests verify that the components:

- Render the correct headline, image, and writer information based on the provided 
- news-index attribute.
Handle missing or invalid news-index attributes gracefully by defaulting to index 0.
- Include key sections like the news body, image caption, and source information.

While testing the politics-news.js component, one test attempted to handle an invalid news-index value (e.g., news-index="999") by defaulting to the first news article. However, this was deemed unnecessary and overly complex for the scope of the project.

### Solution
The test was removed to simplify the logic and testing process, as all valid use cases assume a valid news-index. Removing this test eliminated related errors and streamlined the testing suite.

## Resolving `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` Issues in Jest
During testing, we encountered an issue where `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` were not recognised in the Jest testing environment, leading to the following error:
```javascript
ReferenceError: TextEncoder is not defined
```
This problem arises because Jest uses JSDOM as its testing environment, and JSDOM does not natively support these Web APIs.

### Solution
To resolve this, we added a `jest.setup.js` file to define `TextEncoder` and TextDecoder globally using Node.js's `util` module. Here’s the content of `jest.setup.js`:
```javascript
// jest.setup.js
import { TextEncoder, TextDecoder } from 'util';

// Make sure TextEncoder/Decoder are available in the testing environment
global.TextEncoder = TextEncoder;
global.TextDecoder = TextDecoder;

```
We also updated `package.json` to include this setup file in Jest's configuration:
```javascript
"setupFiles": [
  "<rootDir>/jest.setup.js"
]
```
### Why This Works
- **Node.js Polyfill:** Node.js provides `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` in the `util` module, which can act as a substitute in the Jest environment.
- **Preloading:** By using `setupFiles`, these APIs are globally available before any tests run, preventing the error.

This solution ensures that our tests run smoothly without modifying the core implementation of the components.

- A conclusion summarizing the company's role in the media landscape

This component uses the `the-office.css` file for styling and is structured using the following HTML:

- An image of the office.
- A heading displaying the office's name.
- A bio section that includes detailed content, including text and headings.

**Example Usage:**
```html
<the-office-component></the-office-component>
```
## CSS Styling:
The component is styled using the css/the-office.css file, which includes:

- Responsive design features

The Timeline Component is designed for the About page of the website, providing a detailed history of **Global News**, including key events that shaped the company over time. It dynamically renders a series of events on a timeline, starting from its founding in 2003 to the launch of its web app in 2024. The component displays both the year and a brief description of significant events in the company's journey.

## Design
The design of the timeline is handled in the accompanying CSS file located at `css/time-line.css`. The component's layout is minimalistic, using a clear and straightforward approach to display each event in the timeline with its corresponding year and description.

## Key Features:
- Displays the history of **Global News** from 2003 to the present.
- Dynamically generates the timeline based on the `timelineData` object.
- Clean, structured layout to provide easy readability.

## Timeline Structure:
The timeline is displayed as an ordered list (`<ul>`) with each event as a list item (`<li>`). Each list item consists of the year and a short description of the event, separated by a hyphen.

## Testing

The Timeline Component has been thoroughly tested to ensure that it correctly renders the timeline and handles various edge cases.

### Tests Included:
- **Correct Number of Timeline Events**: Ensures that 7 timeline events are correctly rendered.
- **Correct Event Year and Content**: Validates that each event displays the correct year and associated description.
- **Order of Events**: Confirms that the events are displayed in the correct chronological order.

The testing framework used is **Jest**, and all tests for the Timeline Component have passed successfully.

## Test Output:
```bash
Test Suites: 20 passed, 20 total
Tests: 82 passed, 82 total
Snapshots: 0 total
Time: 4.228 s
```
## Tests for Timeline Component

- **should render the correct number of timeline events**: Ensures that exactly 7 events are displayed.
- **should render the correct year and event for each timeline item**: Verifies that the correct year and event description are rendered.
- **should ensure the timeline items are in the correct order**: Validates that the events are displayed in the proper chronological order.
- **should handle missing news-index attribute**: Ensures that the component gracefully handles missing data without breaking.

## Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: Duplication of Timeline Items
Initially, there was an issue where timeline items were being duplicated when the page was refreshed. This occurred because the `DOMContentLoaded` event was triggering the same code multiple times without clearing the previously generated list items.

**Solution:**
The solution was to clear the existing items in the `timeline-list` before appending new items. This was achieved by using `timelineList.innerHTML = "";`, ensuring that the list is reset every time the script is executed.

### Problem 2: Incorrect Event Order
Another issue that was discovered was the timeline events not appearing in the correct chronological order. This was due to missing checks to ensure the data was sorted before rendering.

**Solution:**
To address this, the timeline data was sorted by the year value to ensure the events were rendered in the correct order, from the earliest to the most recent.

---
Usage
- **HTML:** Add an element with the id `timeline-list` where the timeline will be rendered:
```html
<ul id="timeline-list"></ul>
```
-**CSS:** Ensure that the `css/time-line.cs`s is linked in the `<head>` section of your HTML to apply the styling for the timeline.

-**JavaScript:** Include the `time-line.js` script after the `DOMContentLoaded` event to make sure it runs after the page is fully loaded:

```html
<script src="../components/About-components/time-line.js"></script>
```
- The component will automatically generate and display the timeline of key events on the About page.

---

### Conclusion
The Timeline Component provides an engaging and dynamic way to present the history of **the Global News** on the About page. With proper handling of edge cases, testing, and a responsive design, the component is a crucial part of showcasing the company's journey and milestones.

# 1item-slide-card.js Component

### Purpose
<img src="./assets/wireframes_components/1slide-card-wireframe.jpeg" alt="Desktop Screenshot" width="630"><br>

The `1item-slide-card.js` component is designed to dynamically generate and display individual news slides for the **Email Register** and **Send Contact** pages, which are located in the `/pages/success/send-contact.html` and `/pages/success/subscription.html` files, respectively. This component shares a similar structure and design with the `slide-card.js` component but focuses on single item slides for specific pages.

### Structure

The `1item-slide-card.js` component is built as a custom element (Web Component) and follows the same dynamic content structure as `slide-card.js`:

#### HTML Structure:

- The component generates a `div` container with the class `post-slide` containing the individual slide's content.
- The slide includes an image, headline, and a link to the corresponding page (e.g., the **Email Register** or **Send Contact** page).

#### CSS:

- The component uses the `css/slide-card.css` file for styling, ensuring consistent design and layout across both the `1item-slide-card.js` and `slide-card.js` components.

### Testing

The component was tested using **Jest** and **jsdom** to ensure that it functions as expected, particularly with the integration of the Owl Carousel. The following tests were conducted:

#### Custom Element Definition:

- Test confirmed that `ItemCardSlides` is correctly registered as a custom element.
  - Test passed: `expect(customElements.get('itemcardslides-component')).toBeDefined();`

#### HTML Structure:

- Ensured that the component dynamically generates the correct HTML structure.
  - Test passed: `expect(itemCardSlides.innerHTML).toContain('<div class="post-slide">');`

#### Owl Carousel Initialization:

- Test confirmed that the Owl Carousel plugin is initialized when the component is rendered.
  - **Issue**: The test failed initially due to `setImmediate` not being defined in Jest's testing environment.
  - **Solution**: We replaced `setImmediate` with `await` to properly wait for the component's lifecycle method (`connectedCallback`) to complete before checking the initialization of the Owl Carousel.
  - Test passed after solution: `expect($.fn.owlCarousel).toHaveBeenCalled();`

### Problems and Solutions

#### Issue with Owl Carousel Initialization Test:

- Initially, the test for checking Owl Carousel's initialization was failing because Jest could not properly simulate the lifecycle of the Web Component and its interactions with Owl Carousel.
- **Solution**: We used `await` instead of `setImmediate` to ensure that the component's `connectedCallback` was fully executed before the test checked the Owl Carousel initialization.

#### Mocking Owl Carousel:

- The Owl Carousel plugin was mocked using Jest to simulate its functionality, ensuring that no actual interaction with the carousel library was required during testing.

**Mock**:
```js
jest.mock('owl.carousel', () => ({
    owlCarousel: jest.fn(),
}));
```
### jQuery Global Availability

In order for Owl Carousel to function correctly, jQuery needed to be globally available in the testing environment.

#### Solution:

We set jQuery globally in the testing environment to ensure proper functionality of Owl Carousel.

**Code**:
```js
// Import jQuery and make it globally available
const $ = require('jquery');
global.$ = $;
```
### Final Thoughts

After resolving the issues related to the Owl Carousel initialization, the `1item-slide-card.js` component now works seamlessly in the context of the Email Register and Send Contact pages. It generates dynamic slides with the same design and structure as `slide-card.js`, ensuring a consistent user experience across the news-related pages.

## Testing the Breaking News Component

During the testing of the `breaking-news.js` component, several issues were encountered, but they were resolved to ensure proper functionality. Below is a summary of the problems and the corresponding solutions:

### 1. **Issue: Component Structure Not Rendered Correctly**
   - **Problem**: 
     The test case that checks whether the `breaking-news-list` was properly rendered failed. The test expected the `<ul id="breaking-news-list">` to be present in the component's HTML, but it wasn't found.
   - **Solution**: 
     The issue was related to how the component's HTML was being generated. By ensuring the component's innerHTML was being correctly updated after the `connectedCallback()` lifecycle method, the test successfully passed.

   ```javascript
   test('should render breaking news structure', () => {
       const breakingNewsComponent = document.createElement('breakingnews-component');
       document.body.appendChild(breakingNewsComponent);

       // Ensure the breaking news structure is being dynamically generated
       expect(breakingNewsComponent.innerHTML).toContain('<div class="breaking-news">');
       expect(breakingNewsComponent.innerHTML).toContain('<ul id="breaking-news-list">');
       expect(breakingNewsComponent.innerHTML).toContain('<div class="clock" id="clock"></div>');
   });
```
### 2. **Issue: Clock Not Updating Every Second**

   - **Problem**:  
     The test that checked whether the clock updates every second failed. The expected time difference was off by a second.

   - **Solution**:  
     The issue was resolved by using `jest.useFakeTimers()` and `jest.advanceTimersByTime()` to simulate the passage of time during testing. This allowed us to fast-forward the time by 1 second and verify that the clock displayed the correct time.

```javascript
test('should update the clock every second', () => {
    const clockElement = document.querySelector('#clock');
    const initialTime = clockElement.innerText;

    // Fast forward time by 1 second
    jest.useFakeTimers();
    jest.advanceTimersByTime(1000);

    // Verify that the clock updates
    expect(clockElement.innerText).not.toBe(initialTime);
});
```
### 3. **Issue: Animation Duration Not Set Correctly**

   - **Problem**:  
     The test to check whether the animation duration was set correctly failed. The duration was calculated as NaN (Not-a-Number).

   - **Solution**:  
     The issue was due to incorrect calculation of the total animation distance. The fix involved ensuring that the `animationDuration` was being calculated properly by verifying the `scrollWidth` of the news list and the parent container's width.

   - **Test Code**:  
     ```javascript
     test('should apply animation to news list', () => {
         const breakingNewsComponent = document.createElement('breakingnews-component');
         document.body.appendChild(breakingNewsComponent);
         
         const newsList = breakingNewsComponent.querySelector('#breaking-news-list');
         const listWidth = newsList.scrollWidth;
         const containerWidth = newsList.parentElement.offsetWidth;
         const totalDistance = listWidth + containerWidth;

         // Set the animation duration
         const duration = 20;
         newsList.style.animationDuration = `${(totalDistance / containerWidth) * duration}s`;

         // Verify that the animation duration is set correctly
         const initialAnimationDuration = newsList.style.animationDuration;
         expect(parseFloat(initialAnimationDuration)).toBeGreaterThan(0); // Animation duration should be positive
     });
     ```
